# SizedBox, Flexible and Flex Widgets

Flexible is a built-in widget in flutter which controls how a child of base flex widgets that are Row, Column, and Flex will fill the space available to it. The Expanded widget in flutter is shorthand of Flexible with the default fit of FlexFit.tight. Flexible widget plays a very important part in making a responsive app that looks and feels the same across multiple device sizes. But if one wants just basic filling up of spaces by widgets, then Expanded is also a good candidate for that.
