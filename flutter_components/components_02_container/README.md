# Container

* Container class in flutter is a convenience widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing of widgets. A Container class can be used to store one or more widgets and position them on the screen according to our convenience. Basically, a container is like a box to store contents. A basic container element that stores a widget has a margin, which separates the present container from other contents. The total container can be given a border of different shapes, for example, rounded rectangles, etc. A container surrounds its child with padding and then applies additional constraints to the padded extent (incorporating the width and height as constraints, if either is non-null).
